        <p style="text-align: left; width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;"> 
            This digital triptych serves as a self portrait that reflects my inner-self and who I see myself as a person. They each represent my mind, body, and soul respectively. Each image chosen and used in the collage has some representation of an aspect of my self.
            <br><br>
            For example, the use of clocks in the collages represent the facts that I often find myself living in the past, rushing for deadlines, but also that I’ve been sometimes called an old soul. The mannequin head represents how I often feel lost in my own mind and body, as I experience a lot of disassociation where I don’t feel like I actually exist in my body. The tightrope walker represents the stress and anxiety that I frequently experience.
            <br><br>
            Overall, the use of vibrant color in the “mind” and “soul” panels of the triptych contrasts with the lack of color in the “body” panel. As an artist and a daydreamer, I sometimes find that reality is much more duller compared to my imagination. In reality, I do, however, consider myself to be a very visual person who enjoys working with their hands and is a very hands-on learner. My style is incorporated in the images in the form of grainy graphic images and
            overlapping illustrations.
