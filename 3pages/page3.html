<p style="font-family:verdana">Excellent choice!</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">I uploaded the photo and got ready to send it in. Oh boy, everyone is gonna <i>LOVE</i> this picture!
    However, as I went to upload the photo, the strangest thing happened...</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"><i>"I liked the other one better."</i> a voice said aloud. </p>
<p style="font-family:verdana">This was strange, considering the only people
who were home was me and Gilbert. I didn't recall saying it, and obviously cats can't talk.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"><i>"Sure they can."</i> the voice spoke again. Gilbert's mouth was
    moving as I heard the words coming from his direction. <i>"We can read minds too, actually."</i> </p>
<p style="font-family:verdana">I stared at Gilbert in disbelief. <i>"Send the other photo?"</i> he asked once more. 
I wasn't sure if my cat was actually talking or if I had just stayed up too late playing Minecraft. Regardless, who could
say no to those adorable eyes? I did as he said, and went back to playing.</p>
